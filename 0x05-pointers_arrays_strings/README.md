#### 0. 98 Battery st.
Write a function that takes a pointer to an int as parameter and updates the value it points to to 98.
+ Prototype: `void reset_to_98(int *n);`

[solution](/0x05-pointers_arrays_strings/0-rest_to_98.c)

#### 1. Don't swap horses in crossing a stream
Write a function that swaps the values of two integers
+ Prototype: `void swap_int(int *a, int *b);`

[solution](/0x05-pointers_arrays_strings/1-swap.c)

#### 2. This report, by its very length, defends itself against the risk of being read
Write a function that returns the length of a string.
+ Prototype: `int _strlen(char *s);`

[solution](/0x05-pointers_arrays_strings/2-strlen.c)

#### 3. I do not fear computers. I fear the lack of them
Write a function that prints a string, followed by a new line, to stdout.
+ Prototype: `void _puts(char *str);`

[solution](/0x05-pointers_arrays_strings/3-puts.c)

#### 4. I can only go one way. I've not got a reverse gear
Write a function that prints a string, in reverse, followed by a new line.
+ Prototype: `void print_rev(char *s);`

[solution](/0x05-pointers_arrays_strings/4-print_rev.c)
