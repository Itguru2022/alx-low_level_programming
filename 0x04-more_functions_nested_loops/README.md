## More About Functions And Nested Loops
Solution to complex problems using functions and nested loops.

#### 0. isupper
Write a function that checks for if a character is uppercase.
* Prototype: `int _isupper(int c);`
* Returns `1` if `c` is uppercase
* Returns `0` otherwise

[solution](/0-isupper.c)

#### 1. isdigit
Write a function that checks for if a character is a digit.
* Prototype: `int _isdigit(int c);`
* Returns `1` if `c` is a digit
* Returns `0` otherwise

[solution](/1-isdigit.c)

#### 2. Collaboration is multiplication
Write a function that multiplies two integers.
* Prototype: `int mul(int a, int b)`

[solution](/2-mul.c)

#### 3. The numbers speak for themselves
Write a function that prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, followed by a new line.
* Prototype: `void print_numbers(void);`
* You can only use `_putchar` twice in your code

[solution](/3-print_numbers.c)

#### 4. I believe in numbers and signs
Write a function that prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, followed by a new line.
* Prototype: `void print_most_numbers(void);`
* Do not print 2 and 4
* You cn only use `_putchar` twice in your code

[solution](/4-print_most_numbers.c)

#### 5. Numbers constitute the only universal language
Write a function that prints 10 times the numbers, from 0 to 14, followed by a new line.
* Prototype: `void more_numbers(void);`
* You can only use `_putchar` three times in your code.

[solution](/5-more_numbers.c)

#### 6. The shortest distance between two points is a straight line
Write a function that draws a straight line in the terminal.
* Prototype: `void print_line(int n);`
* You can only use the `_putchar` function to print
* Where `n` is the number of times the character `_` should be printed
* The line shold end with a `\n`
* if `n` is 0 or less, the function should only print `\n`

[solution](/6-print_line.c)

#### 7. I feel like I am diagonally parked in a parallel universe
Write a function that draws a diagonal line in the terminal.
* Prototype: `void print_diagonal(int n);`
* You can only use the `_putchar` function to print
* Where `n` is the number of times the character `\` should be printed
* The line shold end with a `\n`
* if `n` is 0 or less, the function should only print `\n`

[solution](/7-print_diagonal.c)
