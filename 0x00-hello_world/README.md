### 0x00 Hello World
Day Zero of my **C** programming journey.
This project would contain the following tasks:


##### 0-preprocessor
This script runs a C file through the preprocessor and saves the result into another file.
* The C file name should be saved in the variable `CFILE`
* The output would be saved in the file `c`

##### 1-compiler 
This script compiles a C file but does not link.
* The C file name should be saved in the variable `CFILE`
* The output file would be named the same as the C file, but with the extension `.o` instead of `.c`

##### 2-assembler
This script generates the assembly code of a C code and saves it to an output file.
* The C file name should be saved in the variable `CFILE`
* The output file would be named the same as the C file, but with the extension `.s` instead of `.c`

##### 3-name
This script compiles a C file and creates an executable named `cisfun`.
* The C file should be saved in the variable `CFILE`
